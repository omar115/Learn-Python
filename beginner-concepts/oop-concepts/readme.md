# Classes
- A class is a blueprint for creating new objects

# Object
- instance of the class

# examples
- Class: Human
- Objects: John, Mary, Jack

# Is instance
- it is used to check or verify if an object is 
associated/in the class or not

# Constructor
- a special method which is executed at the time of
creation of an object

# Self
- self is a refence of current object

# class vs instance attributes
- class attributes shared all instances inside a class

# class vs instance method
- method that defined inside a class is called instance method

# Magic methods
- examples:

__init__(), __str__(), etc.

- it will be called automically

# Inheritence ?
- it is a mechanism that allows us to define common behavior
or common function in one class and then inherit them in other
classes.
- IS-A relationship: e.g. Mammal IS A animal, so it will inherit
animal class
- Here animal is the base class and Mammal is the sub class

# super()
- using super() we can call parent init method
